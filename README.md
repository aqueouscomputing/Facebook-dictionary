Facebook dictionary attack tool, written in Perl. This code is compatible with Linux, and Windows computers that have installed Perl interpreters. Of course the attack is picked up on after 10 or 15 unsuccessful attempts; however I am currently working on making the code change both the IP address (by running it through a ToR node or a list of proxy servers) as well as the User-Agent String, every X amount of seconds. Hopefully, in making this work, it could potentially trick Facebook's servers into viewing the attack to be coming from several computers, not just one. This may or may not work, but it's worth a try. Any help in this is appreciated. Nevertheless, if that does not work, this tool is still fun to toy around with.
